# Wacom Device Kit - Bluetooth Stylus SDK for iOS

> IMPORTANT NOTE
> This series of Wacom products is now discontinued and support for them is no longer offered.

## Introduction

What you can do with the Bluetooth Stylus SDK for iOS:

The Wacom Stylus iOS SDK gives you the tools you need so that your app can interface with Wacom stylus products.
• Pair your app with stylus products and iPads or iPhones by Bluetooth Smart, based on the Core Bluetooth framework.
• Capture pressure data so you can use that information to add drawing or writing to your app.
• Make your app easier to use by applying a function to stylus buttons.
• Improve line quality in your app by letting the SDK handle touch information for you and by accessing coalesced touch information.
• Enhance the accuracy of your app by incorporating touch rejection.

Integrating support for Wacom stylus products in your drawing or handwriting app gives your app users a convenient way to work in your application.
