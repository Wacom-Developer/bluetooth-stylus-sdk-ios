# Bluetooth Stylus SDK for iOS

## Version 2.2.5

## History

### 2.2.5  01-Jun-2020
    - Rebuilt zip file

### 2.2.4  07-Nov-2019
    - Add Support for iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max, and iPad 10.2
    - Know Issue:
          When using one of the Wacom Pens on the iPad 10.2 that is running iPadOS 13.2, sections of the drawn line are blank.
          This behavior is caused by Appleâ€™s iPadOS sending touchesCancel events rather that touchesMoved events.
          A defect was filed with Apple. The BluetoothStylusSdk helps fix this behavior, but is ineffective when the pen is perpendicular to the iPad.
